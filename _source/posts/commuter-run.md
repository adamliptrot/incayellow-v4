        comment : "I have recently fitted a battery cut off switch behind the drivers seat.  Possibly the most useful and reassuring thing I have done to my 1971 BGT.  After some research I decided to put it on the 'earth' line.  With only one battery (now) there was ample space and the job was very easy."

I've always wondered what it'd be like using the B for the commute. Today commuting was a lot more fun than normal!


My commute is 32 miles or so each way, mainly dual carriageways but the last few miles tend to get very busy and there's often a fair amount of queues as you approach the city centre. In all it normally takes a little under an hour door-to-door.


After a little lumpy running as the B objected to the early morning start the commute run went smoothly and it was soon tucked up at the multi-storey - one good thing about the B is that parking is simple thanks to its narrow body!


This isn't going to be a regular thing - the B isn't as economic with fuel as my daily driver and my insurance is mileage limited at the moment, so I'm saving those miles for other trips - but it proves it can be done without any dramas.


Couple of things I think I'd add if I was going to use it for regular commuting - some new speakers. The ones fitted don't have quite enough clarity to be heard properly while cruising at 70mph. The other thing is a battery cut-off switch, just to make me feel a bit better when leaving it all day in a multi-storey.
