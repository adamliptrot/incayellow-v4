My middle exhaust bracket had rusted through just above the bolt. Luckily replacements are pretty cheap and easy to fit.


The bracket is bolted onto the body with two bolts held by captive nuts. This is then bolted onto a U-shaped carrier, the long bolt passing through bushes. While the bracket bolts came out relatively easily, the OEM style horseshoe also has a strap over the top of the exhaust, effectively clamping the pipe. The bolts holding this together were rusted and would not shift, so I had to resort to cutting through the strap with an angle-grinder. This was the first time I'd used my recent purchase on the car and I was definitely glad I had it - otherwise it would have been a hacksaw job, difficult in the restricted work area.
