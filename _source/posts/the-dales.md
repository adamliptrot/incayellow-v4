A day's tour of the Dales.


What was going to be a short run out turned into a 4-5 hour drive as the weather, scenery and car were too good to go home. General route used was Leyburn - Hawes - Buttertubs Pass - Murker - Kirby Stephen see <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Thirsk/Leyburn,+North+Yorkshire+DL8/Hawes/MUKER/KIRKBY+STEPHEN/54.4423483,-1.6701991/@54.445842,-1.6847474,10z/data=!4m33!4m32!1m5!1m1!1s0x487ea52d78452a8b:0x86c95596204ea59a!2m2!1d-1.341377!2d54.233849!1m5!1m1!1s0x487c0de85bdc8b43:0x328493be4869aa68!2m2!1d-1.826792!2d54.309591!1m5!1m1!1s0x487c6e9c56c6020d:0x9804346171f82b42!2m2!1d-2.198943!2d54.304019!1m5!1m1!1s0x487c6aef50da2d49:0x24a238690153123!2m2!1d-2.1401165!2d54.3767024!1m5!1m1!1s0x487c42ae313bc13b:0x821161528336bfc!2m2!1d-2.348925!2d54.474279!1m0!3e0">route on Google Maps</a>
