            <h2>How we got here</h2>
            <div class="backstory__one">
                <p>In late 2007 I was very fortunate to aquire a 1979 MGB GT from a member of my family. Even though it had been <a href="/posts/uncovered/">sat in a garage</a> largely untended for about 17 years and had to be <a href="/posts/ready-to-move/">trailered home</a>, I was very excited to get hold of it.</p>
                <p>When we pushed the B out of the garage it'd been sat in, I had no idea how an engine worked, no idea what a carburettor did, but getting it back on the road has been one of the best things I've done.</p>

                <img src="/assets/images/TheTeam.jpg" alt="Ken and Adam side-by-side with the B at the Chatsworth Kimber Run" />
            </div>
            <div class="backstory__two">
                <p>Throughout the project I've lent heavily on the mechanical knowledge of Ken Moody, who has very patiently explained how everything works, especially the electrics. He's given me the confidence to work on areas where I would probably have faltered on my own and I definitely wouldn't have got as far on this project without him.</p>
                <p>Ken passed away during the Christmas holidays of 2010 and will be sorely missed, both for his knowledge and friendship.</p>
