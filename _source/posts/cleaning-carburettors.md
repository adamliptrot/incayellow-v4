While I've got the carbs. off, I thought I'd shine them up a bit and clear any gunk from around the linkages.


I started with some carburettor cleaner spray and a toothbrush to get rid of the worse of the grime. After a couple of runs at it, they were looking much better. The shine was added using some Autosol metal polish and a bunch of elbow grease. Fig 1 has the cleaned set on the left and the other one for comparision, but hopefully you could tell that.
