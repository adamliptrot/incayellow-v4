Oil changes. New engine, gearbox and differential oil along with a new filter. I used some Blue Hylomar on the diff plugs as it has been leakiing a little, so hopefully this might fix it. Also managed to break, fix and then break my timing light in the space of a day, so I'm going to take the opportunity to buy a nicer one with a dial-back advance to make dynamic timing a little easier.
