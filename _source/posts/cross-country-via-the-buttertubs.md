Time for another run across the Pennines. My usual run is along the A66, which is a much nicer route now its been made a dual-carriageway. However this weekend it was the Appleby Fair which meant I'd need an alternate route, one which just happened to include the Buttertubs Pass.


The Buttertubs Pass is a proper driver's road with nice gradual and tight turns, great scenery, steep climbs, long drops and very little traffic.


Unfortunately I would use the Buttertubs only on the return route by which time the rain and low clouds had set in - you can see from the photo what it was like at the bottom - in fact it rained the whole way back. On the other hand I did have a day of great weather the day before for the outward trip which meant I could at least get some decent video and a couple of shots on the way.
