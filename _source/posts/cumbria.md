        Now, the next time you come to our interesting country, you should consider the Central Coast of California, with very many beautiful places, and great weather for you to 'borrow an MGB' and go for a ride.



        More than half the MGBs sold in the US, were sold in California."

Recent drive around Cumbria near Appleby.


Thought I'd add the odd photo in between the 'proper' posts as sometimes I end up with decent shots but no work to associate them with. This is a shot of the road from Appleby to Tebay in Cumbria. Unfortunately they'd just resurfaced with loose tarmac it and I had to take it slow, so stopping to take a quick photo wasn't going to take time out of my journey. In the end the fresh road surface made for a good colour contrast in the fading light.
