A bit of an indulgence, but I needed a workshop mate and this'll be sitting on the car quite a lot, so why not have the MG logo on it? Ordered from the MGOC, this does a great job of protecting the wing and unlike the towel I was using doesn't keep slipping off. It could do with some weights sewing into the bottom of it as occasionally the wind does shift it.
