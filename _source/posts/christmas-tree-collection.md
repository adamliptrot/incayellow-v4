This is something I'd be wanting to do for a while.

For this I'd got hold of a second-hand Thule roof-bar set and a Thule roof-rack. I'll be doing a write-up of roof-racks for MGBs as my initial set-up didn't work due to the particular roof curve of the B. 

I really didn't fancy dealing with a tree-trunk becoming embedded in the B's bonnet due to a rope coming loose, so wanted to be confident in how it would be strapped down, but at the same time this would be the first time I'd used a roof-rack so I wanted it to be as easy as possible. To this end rather than trying to tie knots in rope I got hold of a couple of sets of tie-down straps and also had a set of Thule cargo load-stops to feed the straps through. The final set-up held the 7-foot tree in place securly on the 15 mile trip home.
