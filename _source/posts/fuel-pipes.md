This is the fuel pump viewed from underneath, showing the 2 hoses to pull in fuel from the tank and pump it up to the engine.


It's not particularly easy to get hold of without a socket set as there isn't a lot of space, being next to the battery cage. Luckily the top half of the pump is a lot cleaner - good job as that's where the connectors are. Where this one is it is well placed to get loads of rubbish off the tyres.
