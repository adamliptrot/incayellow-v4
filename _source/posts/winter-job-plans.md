Not been many updates lately, due to holidays, but I managed to get a few miles under its belt today. I'm also now thinking forward to the winter jobs for the days when the B will be off the road due to salt spreading.


Top of the list is having a go at the dents the B received and which are driving me nuts every time I look at them. If my attempts don't work out then it might have to be a body-shop job.


Also on the cards are spraying the inner driver's side wing in the engine bay, re-bushing the front suspension and possibly removing the pedal box to tidy up that area.


Could be a busy winter!
