Just a quick post today to show the new garage floor I put down recently.


The dust from the unsealed concrete, along with the spreading oil patches have encouraged me to finally paint the garage floor. This will make the garage a much nicer place to work in, and also make it easier to see if the car's dripping more oil than normal.


I used Ronseal Garage Floor paint. One 500ml tin was just enough to do one diluted undercoat and two additional coats.
