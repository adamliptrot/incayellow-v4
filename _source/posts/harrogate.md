A wet drive down through Yorkshire ended in a clear day in Harrogate.


A couple of things came up as part of the journey - first off the heating seems a little odd at the moment. Whilst the heater is putting out plenty of hot air, the vent lever doesn't seem to be closing the footwell vents properly which results in a lot of cold air somewhat negating the heat output elsewhere.


Secondly, with the weather getting colder the lack of a functioning rear-window demister is starting to be an issue. I'll have to sort out the severed wiring if possible, though I don't think it'll be an easy job.
