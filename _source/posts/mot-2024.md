With the service done, the emissions hopefully much closer to where they should be and the errant brake switch and fog light replaced it was finally MOT time.

Everything passed with no issues. A small hole on the edge of the exhaust backbox gained an advisory, but the brakes were complimented on (I'd adjusted them when on full lock they were found to crab the car sideways). Even the exhaust emissions passed, maybe a touch rich on idle but lovely at full chat.
