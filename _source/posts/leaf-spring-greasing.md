I managed to win a bid on a Terry leaf spring greaser, [after seeing one on another site](https://mgb.tips/2020/01/15/leaf-spring-greaser/) (I didn't even know they were a thing) and thinking it'd be useful for the B.

The leaf springs have a plastic type layer between each leaf to assist in them moving across each other. But sometimes it feels like the suspension can be a bit "crashy", so I figured some help wouldn't be a bad idea.

The greaser looks like a G-clamp, but the jaws have knifed ends to seperate the leafs. The screw part also has a hole drilled through it and has a grease gun attachment to allow the feeding in of grease once the spring has been prised apart. Mine seems to be missing part of the grease gun attachment (looking at the photos in the link above), which makes sense as it was difficult to get a good connection.

It works really well in that it manages to create enough space to inject fresh grease and push out all the old stuff along with all the road grime. As the springs are still clamped, it is necessary to inject grease at multiple points along each leaf, so it does take a little while to unclamp and reclamp. The bonus being that it does actually seem to have made the ride at the rear of the car that bit more relaxed.
