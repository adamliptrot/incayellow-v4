I have a plan. The B is suffering a little from a lot of small blemishes in the form of rust spots and paint chips caused by years of happy driving. The plan is to sort these out and make the B a little more presentable in the process - and ensure they don't become larger problems.

I've gone over the bodywork and taken photos and marked the location of any areas where there is a spot of rust starting. Some of these, like the headlight bowl where it meets the chrome strip I have looked at before, but I have better knowledge now, and some better anti-rust products.
