Start of the driving season and time for a few service items.


Very quick update - got some new leads, spark plugs, rotor arms and distributor cap. The cap hasn't been changed since I first got the car started so that was well overdue, same with the leads. The rotor arms were a bit of an issue - the Accuspark conversion means the arm needs to have a collar and I couldn't work out how to make the new cut-down arms work the with separate collar supplied with the Accuspark kit (up to now I was using the rotor with in-built collar supplied in the kit). So I've left this for now until I can have a look at the instructions some more.
