We had another short stay in Scotland which we decided to take the B for again after the [trip earlier in the year](/posts/scotland/).

For this trip we were staying somewhere a tad more remote, so more narrow lanes (and sheep) to deal with but the B is ideal for this kind of thing.

On the way back as we hit a very long incline there was a hint of a hesitation followed by the odd reocurrence. This wasn't the same issue as we'd had ([and fixed](/posts/rolling-road-session/)) previously as the rev counter was steady when it happened. This made me think it might be fuel related rather than ignition, so we pulled over and changed out the fuel filter - this is something I'd not changed for a while so it was overdue. 

No change as another hesitation came along, so I also changed the distributor cap, rotor and ignition leads. This still didn't fix it but the issue seemed to lessen so we took it easy on the way back and it got us the 200 miles home safely.

A chat on the forums suggested it could be due to the way the external ballast had been wired (inline with the old rather than truly replacing it). But as I was swapping out the exhaust and [removing and replacing the carbs](/posts/fuel-lines,-needle-jets-and-heat-shield/), one of the float needles turned out to be sticking. This was causing restricted fuel to the carbs enough for the engine not to start, so I expect this may have been the cause of the blip.
