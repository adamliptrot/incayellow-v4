The B has had an oil leak down the side of the engine from the tappet chest covers. I think it is a mix of the rubber seals on the washers failing and the seals gradually perishing.

My money was on the bolt washers, but to replace those I would need to remove the exhaust manifold so you might as well replace all the seals. Fortunately this coincided with [replacing the exhaust](/posts/exhaust-replacement/).

I last did this about [12 years ago](/posts/tappet-cover-seals/) but luckily I write up this stuff so I don't have to remember which seal goes where.
