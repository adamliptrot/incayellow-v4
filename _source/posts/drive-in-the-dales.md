I'm hoping to get a bit more video up on the site, so we'll start off with a bit of in-car footage from our latest run around the Yorkshire Dales. The sound isn't too great and you can't hear much of the engine, partly due to a bit of wind noise from a couple of gaps in the window rubber, so I'll do a bit of patching and try again.
