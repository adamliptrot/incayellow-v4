As this is a later model MG it has just the one battery bin under the rear seat - you can see the black cover here. It is a really tight fit so getting the battery in and out can be a pain, especially as the positive lead is really short. With the metal seat base in close proximity you have to be careful when tightening the connector - it's given me a shock once already.
