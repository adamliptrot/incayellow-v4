With an MOT coming up, time to do a few maintenance jobs.
<!--more-->
With the usual oil changes, plug inspection, air filter change and general tidying I also tackled the overdrive leak which wasn't fixed by the last gasket swap. This time I used Blue Hylomar non-setting gasket sealant and so far it is looking good - no oil on the plate or on the six screws. There is still oil on the smaller plate so that might need looking at in the future but for now the main issue is sorted.

Also probably on the cards this year will be a brake refresh - new pads up front, new shoes and adjusters at the back - and in all likelihood new tyres all round - these ones have been on the car since we put it back on the road in 2008 so are up for renewal even though they have plenty of tread on them.
