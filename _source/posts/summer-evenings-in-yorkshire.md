I'm lucky in where I live is close to the Yorkshire Dales and the Yorkshire Moors, but even between those two are some excellent roads.

Some lovely evenings this past week meant perfect weather for some sunset drives through the country lanes of North Yorkshire, made even better by the lack of other cars on the road - God knows why; they're missing some beautiful sunsets and driving!
