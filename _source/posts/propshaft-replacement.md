The recent MOT had gone well, but had thrown up a bit of vertical play in the propshaft where the tube shaft enters the tube.

Whilst there was no vibration it seems prudent to swap it out for a new one before it gets worse. The [last one](/posts/changing-the-propshaft/) was a refurbished one, but this time I went for a new one. Given more time I would have had it rebuilt, but I still might so I have a good spare. 

Interestingly whilst the UJs on the new propshaft were grease-filled, the shaft had not been.

Most of the details of removal and refitting have been covered in the previous post. Something to remember is to make sure that the two shafts are aligned with marked arrows pointing together. The shorter end of the propshaft should also be at the front of the car as this protects the joint better.
