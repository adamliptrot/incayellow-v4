        comment : "Hi, love the site! I just saw this post and thought this could be an option on my '77 MG Midget. Then it occurred to me, my doors leak in the rain... In figure 4, is that a water guard? If so, that might be a good addition if I decide to go for door speakers.



        Also, where are they mounted on your doors? Are they low or are they under the winder? I only ask because of the window and mechanism... it would probably foul on he Midget.



        Cheers!"

        comment : "Hi Rikki, I added a new photo to show where the speakers are in relation to the other fittings. Not sure if the metal plate is a water guard or not, but the doors do have a plastic sheeting between the door cards and the door itself to help stop the cards from warping with the water which passes through the door. I think the main problem people seem to have is getting speakers which are shallow enough to fit the doors - even mine which I think were dealer fitted have card spacers to pull them out a little."

        comment : "Hello there, I'm enjoying reading through your blog, way to go on the restoration! I noticed you did not mention the foam surround on these speakers, you can get replacements (yours are totally rotted away) that will make an amazing difference to the low and mid range. My local guys are: http://www.mainelectronics.com/surround.htm but there must be a supplier in the UK.



        cheers!"

The B has a speaker in each door card, but the sound has always been a bit scratchy, so it seemed a good idea to pull them apart and clean the connections.


I'm not sure if these were factory fitted or not, but dealer or factory they made a good job with clean cuts in the door card. The speakers themselves are Pioneer TS-107s which date them to between 1979 and 1985 and they still put out a good measure of sound in the small cabin.


After removing the speakers it was clear that the junction connection which mated the wires from the radio to the wires from the speaker had rusted up totally. This meant that instead of just adjusting the wires I had to re-strip them and replace the junction too, but it now means the speakers are crackle-free.


One good thing about removing the speakers was that it gave me the opportunity to have a look inside the door itself. Good to see that the inner surfaces had all been waxoiled and that the drain holes were clear. It is also a good entry point for redoing the waxoil in the future.
