Bit of a rainy day, so the car was left in the garage to fit the fuel pump. I chose a solid state fuel pump for reliability.


The old one was a bit of a nightmare to get out as the rubber 'neck' which secured it inside the boot was pretty much knackered, but a good bit of shoving and a heavy screwdriver managed to release it.
