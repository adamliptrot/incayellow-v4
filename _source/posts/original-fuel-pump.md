The original fuel pump isn't working, which you can easily tell as they should make a 'tock-tock-tock' sound when the ignition is on, and if you've a clear fuel filter you will see some fuel run in.


It is probably the points which have corroded up and you can clean them up, but I think I'll order a new one and keep this one as a spare. The good thing is that at least being mounted in the boot, the top half is clean and we can reuse the existing connectors.


The rubber neck has perished a bit, so it is really stubborn to shift and it'll need a push/pull to get it out.
