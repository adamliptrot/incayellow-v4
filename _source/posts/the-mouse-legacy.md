Spent most of today cleaning out the area behind the pedal box. This looks like it's where the mice had their nest, bless 'em.


They'd managed to pull in a huge bundle of shredded black plastic bags and I filled a Dyson with various bits of other debris from their nest area. This is (I think) the heater wiring which has either been gnawed or has just perished. You can also see the amount of rust which has hit the engine bay. Once the mechanics are all working, that'll be the next thing to hit.
