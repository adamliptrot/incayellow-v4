This is one of my favourite local routes. Over the moors by way of Clay Bank and Chop Gate it has a fair few steep inclines but it pays off with sweeping corners and lovely scenery. A bonus is that it is off the main trail of the A19 and Whitby roads so is only really used for those few wanting to traverse the moors north to south.

Our end journey is normally Helmsley which is a picturesque market town on the south side of the moors which also has the benefit of a [small brewery](https://www.helmsleybrewingco.co.uk/) selling some fantasic beers.
