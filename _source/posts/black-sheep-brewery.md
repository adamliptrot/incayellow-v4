A trip down to Masham and the Black Sheep Brewery for a tour followed by lunch and a walk into the village for a coffee at Johnny Baghdad's - which I can recommend all of. There is also a lovely stretch of road from the A1 to Masham which is perfect for the B if you can hit it when there is no traffic.
