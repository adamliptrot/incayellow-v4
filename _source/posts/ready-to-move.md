        comment : "Hello!  Picking up a 1979 MBG tomorrow.  It's been stored since 1980 and only has 4k miles on it.  Does need some restoration, but excited about the find.  Been watching this car for many years.

Collection day - she took a bit of a push to get out of the garage. Luckily the tyres inflated and stayed that way and once we started pushing, the brakes released. Thanks to all the helping hands.


You can see the amount of dust which accumulated where the covers hadn't stayed on over the years.


We certainly got a few appreciative looks on the 2 hour drive back home.
