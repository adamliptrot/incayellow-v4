        I too have a '79 Inca yellow BGT (owned 22 years) for and need to get a replacement carb heatshield.



        I see that; the '73-'76 one will fit (but doesn't have the asbestos based insulation of the post '76 heatshield) but fits the same side of the spacers as the original and then there the stainless version you've gone for which fits the other side of the spacers and wondered how it's performed since you fitted it ... any fuel vaporization / starvation issues?



        Kind regards



        Richard"

        No problems with the stainless steel heatshield, been running it a good while now and had nothing which would suggest it's causing issues from lack of heat protection. As you have obviously realised the stainless shield which I got sits the other side of the spacers and so is that much further away from the heat source and I'd guess the reflective surface helps too.

The MG has been sitting in my grandad's garage for about 17 years, so it actually looks in pretty good nick. The tyres are totally flat which is to be expected.
