The start of the run had already given us a taste of what was to come, albeit not quite as tense! We saw plenty of other runners in the next hour or so, and it was good to see that it wasn't only us who could miss a turning!


After a very pleasant Sunday lunch in a roadside pub (I can recommend the <a href="http://www.thebullatfoolow.co.uk">Bulls Head</a>) watching streams of MGs pass by we got back on the road. Some of the next routes would have us questioning if we'd took a wrong turn as some of the roads resembled farm-tracks with no passing places and we were relieved when we emerged without coming across a tractor in the opposite direction!
