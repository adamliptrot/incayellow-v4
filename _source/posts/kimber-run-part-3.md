While some of the first half was inches from hedgerows, the second half gave us some spectacular views of the surrounding countryside (though of course behind the compulsory Sunday driver!).


When we arrived back at Chatsworth we parked up for a chat with some of the other drivers, took some photos (including one of me and Ken) let some of the Estate's visitors have a wander around the cars. In all it was a fantastic day out and we were definitely blessed with probably the best weather of the year so far - no doubt much to the relief, and benefit, of the non-GT drivers! It wasn't quite what I'd expected - it was better, the 'treasure-trail' aspect of the tulip diagram map added to the fun. I admit I was a little disappointed we couldn't drive through the Estate from the main (private) gates as the run I'd seen a couple of year's back had done, but the house-side picturesque staging area made up for this.


Definitely a run to keep an eye on for next year!
