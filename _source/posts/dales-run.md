With the nights drawing in I'm trying to get as much driving in as possible, so we took off in the MG for a run around the Yorkshire Dales. We clocked up around 100 miles in all, passing through a bunch of lovely villages.

I also thought it was about time I made a personal appearance in one of the photos (well, more than <a href="/posts/2008/06/fitting-the-fuel-pump/" rel="nofollow">just my legs</a>) - helped by having someone else to do the shooting. I also took a bunch of photos for the insurance company who need them to accurately value the car, so I've posted those too. They give a nice overview of the car and make a nice change from all the work-in-progress close-ups of car parts.
