Before the summer driving season came around again I wanted to recore my radiator.

As you can see from the photos the old rad was in dire need of sorting out and once removed from the car the extent of the rust issue was apparent. New standard radiators run at around Â£150 with postage but as the tanks looked to be in pretty good nick I opted for a recore at a local engineering place which came to about the same, but give a local firm some money and keeps the car a little more original.

For my future reference - 2 litres of coolant emptied into the system and then topped up with water is about right for 25-30% concentration.
