First proper run of the year took us over to the Lake District.


No problems on the trip for the B which munched up the miles doing 70mph in OD and a touch over 3000 rpm. Didn't see any other Bs, but did get buzzed by a 1970s Aston Martin V8 which looked to be on a testing run. Also saw a very nice Austin Seven pootling along some country lanes.
