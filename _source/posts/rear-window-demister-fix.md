I'd tried fixing the broken heater wiring before but this time it seems to be holding. I managed to strip a spade connector and embed it in the old wiring in the window seal with some [Sugru](https://sugru.com/). Hooked up with a matching connector on the wire it seems to be holding. Just have to wait for some frosty weather to see if it lasts.
