Probably a good thing that after losing the electrics, that I would need to drive the B every day for a couple of weeks.
<!--more-->

When something like that happens you always lose a little faith. In true get-back-on-the-horse tradition circumstances meant my daily driver was off the road so I was using the B as every day transport in what was the worst weather of the winter so far. So in blowing gales, freezing temps and icy roads the B has been running over 70 miles per day, with heater, lights and wipers proving to me that the new alternator is just fine, thanks!


And I've loved it as a daily driver - if I lived closer to work I'd consider it full-time for sure.


Yes, it's been running on salty roads, so I think it deserves a wash at the weekend.
